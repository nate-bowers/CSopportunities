        <p>
          Welcome to my project about finding computer science opportunities for kids! I am passionate about
          helping children explore the exciting world of computer science and programming.

        <p>
          The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive resource for parents, educators, and
          young learners to discover various computer science programs, camps, workshops, and online courses
          tailored specifically for kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that early exposure to computer science not only helps children develop important problem-solving
          and critical thinking skills but also sparks their creativity and curiosity in the digital age.
