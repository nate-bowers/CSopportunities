        <p>
          Welcome to my project about helping students interested in computer science find opportunities! I am passionate about
          helping children explore the exciting world of computer science and programming.

        <h2 class="section-title">My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive resource for parents, educators, and
          students to discover various computer science programs, camps, competitions, and online courses
          tailored specifically for kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that easy, organized access to computer science not only helps children develop important problem-solving
          and critical thinking skills but also sparks their creativity and curiosity in the digital age. This set of opportunities is taylored
          to the San Francisco Bay Area.
